## In the Beginning...

At the first time when I read the book '1984' when I was a ten-year old young human, it gave me underlying sensation which force me to imagine what would year 2084 look like, when I would be many, many years old and couldn't resist the world order but obey it. Will it be nice or will it be worse than ever? While I has skeptical vision and be harsh to everything, I didn't imagine the future will be bright. I didn't dare to.

Time passed and, after terrible years of pandemic also passed, the world has been changed rapidly. People are more and more addicted to social media and its notion, its own way of politeness and its interaction. Suddenly Internet 'memes' flushed from nowhere and covered up everywhere it went. Some CEOs from Silicon Valley giants rode the rocket ship and went back to the Earth. Some of them died at deep sea of their home planet. Meanwhile, books, along with natural conversations, also gradually died with individualism, mixture of newborn nationalism.
In developing countries such as South Korea, the conflict between old generation and younger generation is too harsh to bear with. Most of them are based on the different way of receiving rapidly-changing culture, especially abbreviation(based on slang) and technologies.

So, *Newspeak* is already settled down in South Korea society. Here and there. Fewer consonants and vowels, replacing other words with the original form of vocabularies that doesn't contain prefixes, make people more dumber and meaner. Watching every phenomenon as a avid reader of '1984' (read this book more than twenty times), I realised the year 2084 would be exactly same as the world from '1984'.

This is the beginning of this project, which is called '2084'.
What happened around the world? People obeyed the law of computers with loyalty, behaving and thinking alike. Terrible modern UI demonstrates this-even people couldn't complain because they had to wait until bug fixed by tech giants. Computers became humans, meanwhile, won in Go games, draw realistic paints, distinguish dogs and cats, give brighter solutions while 'chatting' with a person, etc. This is what I wanted to implement in the year 2084, dystopian world where computers are look like and behave like organisms.

That's why I built this *2084: A Brutal Reception Desk*. Here's the journey of it.

## Week 0

What if computers use when they observe the world? Might use OpenCV, though, if it would still alive in 2084. Brought the notion of reception desks in the real world, my first plan was if an audience submit their document to a receptionist through a slit, their information would be logged on the National database. That's why I included a webcam, two servos and and transparent acrylics to receive information and design a housing.
