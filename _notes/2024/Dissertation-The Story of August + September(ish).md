August was such a stressful and painful month. Everyone went out for their holiday but there were a huge black mould problem in my new flat. I experienced shortness of breath already. I needed to find new place to live. So, I stopped thinking about my dissertation and more focused on company work. Because that's the only thing that I can enjoy during August. And there's one more motivation for me about simplicity.

![Because I still wanted to bring the tiniest amount of 'poetry' here...](https://github.com/artreadcode/artreadcode.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/2024/IMG_1225.JPG?raw=true)

Because I *still* wanted to bring poetry to my project, I even studied anagram and the method of creating a printed piece of anagram using Quantum computing. However, *that's not the thing that my mind is truly attracted to*. And that's the moment that I stopped thinking about it. My mental health needed a break.

Anyway, I was concentrating on one of the company project, which deals with creative usage of Quantum Machine Learning. (Quantum AI) My colleagues gathered in Moth HQ in which is Somerset House. That was on the first week of September. We did lots of programming and brainstorming like we're in a hackathon. On the final day, after all intense brainstorming, we gathered in the kitchen and naturally we talked about my dissertation. I said in full honesty, that I cannot focus on it because everyone said it's too much for master's thesis. And one of my colleague brought back my courage. He mentioned the complexity of Quantum computing and **it's *already* the best if I can do some Physical computing project with the very basic Quantum computing techniques**. Even only with X gates, etc. I agree with him, too. Because I'm not here to brag myself. I just really want to do something with Physical computing and Quantum computing.

That was the timing when James joined Moth. He's an expert in Qiskit and worked at IBM for many years. He just invited me to one of the Slack channel called [*Micromoth*](https://github.com/moth-quantum/MicroMoth), which is the micro-version of IBM Qiskit which enables users to play Quantum computing with freedom on any hardware. (Because if you're not a physicist or a chemist, rich features are almost pointless.) There's even an old gaming device which ran upon [Lua](https://github.com/moth-quantum/MicroMoth/blob/main/versions/Lua/README.md) which I saw in Internet Archive.

I think this is the perfect moment for me to deep dive into Micromoth and build a library called *Micromoth for Arduino*. Because Micromoth is a open-source project. It's a side hassle for my colleagues. Because there's no such tool for Arduino to run even the very basic Quantum computing simulation. For me, I have a project that I imagined, and that tool is needed. To make it happen. I was at the end of the cave and now I felt like I could see the light.

Another thing will be happen is Qiskit Fall Fest that I'm organising. Because of this, I'm sure that I cannot make a huge leap toward the end. So, I decided to focus on organising the event and before that, I'll just prepare for the meeting with Rebecca and the handover meeting with Polo, because Rebecca will leave next month⋯⋯.
