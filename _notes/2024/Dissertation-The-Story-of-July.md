July 2024 was the first month that I work at [Moth](https://mothquantum.com/). I started my role as a Creative Quantum Developer, so I created lots of ideas of creative quantum applications. From the TouchDesigner project to my will-be dissertation project, Quantum poetry + maze. I created the database of critical reading materials for the idea to narrow down my research question, but whenever time goes by, it's actually getting difficult, not getting easier.

![The complex reading list that I built...](https://github.com/artreadcode/artreadcode.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/2024/Screenshot%202024-10-28%20at%2017.48.18.png?raw=true)

The first issue was about its nature. Everyone, including Rebecca, said it's too complicated for master's thesis. Even my hero, Professor Eduardo Miranda said it's too much for the MSc project. Because in my mind, also from the old habit when I was in South Korea, the master's thesis should be an awesome, A+++++ project which might be posted on Nature, etc. But Rebecca told me it's not necessary. I aware that it's difficult, but I just wanted to cover every subject that I found interesting and with which have a connection.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dzEeIinu84uhtDWo0vHFFGZ8Oxznz4YsvkqS1IN48Ys/edit#slide=id.g117b871a421_0_0)'s the original powerpoint slides for my idealisation, while preparing for the meeting with Rebecca.

I did Quantum Computing Music project called [Quantum Orchestra](https://medium.com/qiskit/these-amazing-quantum-computing-ideas-came-out-of-our-landmark-qiskit-hackathon-global-905a0063f8e5) back in 2020, when I was in IBM Korea. There was Qiskit Hackathon Global and my mentor introduced me to IBM Qiskit, and that's how I started my Quantum computing journey and decided to pursue it. Because our nature, it's all about quantum. It's not working classically. Also our languages. I personally believed music is the fundamental form of our language and found reading materials to support it. However, *Poetry Topology + Music + Quantum?* I agree. It's too much.

![Yes, it's too much.](https://github.com/artreadcode/artreadcode.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/2024/A%20Quantum%20Poet%20System%20Architecture.png?raw=true)

The original plan for this project was building a maze and if the 'entities' inside of the maze interacts, or measured, by the wall, it'll generate melodies based on their movement. It'll be dropped down to the end of the maze. It'll be hung on the wall. But still, I couldn't figure out 'How'. I figured out 'What' and 'Why' but until *How*, there're so many steps that I should go through.

So, I talked to my colleagues at the company. They said make thing *as simple as possible*. That's right. I think my perfectionism blocks the creativity right now.

![The feedback that I've got from Professor Eduardo Miranda](https://github.com/artreadcode/artreadcode.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/2024/Screenshot%202024-10-28%20at%2017.47.46.png?raw=true)

However, I would like to pursue the fundamental concept, **spatial interaction**. I still remember that I studied `Transpiler` in IBM Quantum Challenge 2024. [`Transpiler`](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler) is used for mapping our arbitrary qubits onto the actual physical qubits on Quantum hardwares. (e.g. A *Heron* 133-qubits chip from IBM) All of those qubits are connected to each other topologically.

Also, while working at **Moth**, I saw that there's a research going on about new Quantum computing technique called *Topological Quantum computing*. I stumbled upon this notion from [World Lines](https://www.amycatanzano.com/world-lines#:~:text=In%20one%20of%20many%20possible,what%20I%20call%20a%20%E2%80%9Cquantum), a Quantum Poetry project created by *Amy Catanzano*, who did a small Creative writing project few years ago. Of course, there weren't any single line of codes, but the idea was exciting. In IBM, they're using the technique called *Gate-based Quantum computing*. Here, she used Topological Quantum computing, based on *Majorana fermions*. It's a quantum-scale being called *quasiparticles* where the beings are entangled and disturbed like strings. (from String theory) Amy wrote a poem where the reader can freely explore around each lines so that they can construct the poetic world. There's no computer code, but it's so simple and powerful. It's *enought* to deliver her thoughts and the power of quantum.

Because I want to talk about spatial interaction, I might use Arduino. I searched the projects and found out *Mark Carney* made a [Quantum computing simulation on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/QuantumVillage/micro-quantum). But it should be simpler than this. Because Arduino is much less powerful than Raspberry Pi. Probably this is the next step that I should figure out and only focus on. **Arduino (Physical computing) + Quantum computing**.
