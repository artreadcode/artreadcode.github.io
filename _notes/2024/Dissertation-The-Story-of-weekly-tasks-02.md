As I've mentioned before, now's the time to implement the precious `Micromoth for Arduino` library to the Physical computing part. Before that, I needed to confirm the detailed visualisation sketch and the technical sketch. I was able to do this with the eureka moment, but lot of struggle happened in the background.

The problem was, I still couldn't visualise the exact art installation in my head. The ideal image is from the animated computer music series, [Animusic](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11rcBnKdlyPd--MRTJOMn__12IZ7S2So&si=d4g4a3h25SV3akei), which I first watched 13 years ago (2009!), and which has been the huge inspiration since then. In 'Resonant Chamber', it introduces plucking movements of robot fingers alongside the perfectly synchronised string music.

This served as the building block of my belief when I was 11 years old, the belief which computers can be the composers and partners of musicians. I think that's why I first imagined this similar image in my head and tried to buy the ukulele/guitar for the MSc project. Also, the electric guitar is my main musical instrument. Next, it both sounds and looks awesome in the art exhibition, with its iconic visuals with such a powerful amp⋯⋯.

On Wednesday and Thursday, I finally visited CCI multiple times to pick up the sensors and be given an advice. I haven't seen Matt from last year's PComp class, so I talked to him with my art installation idea. And the first reaction that came out from him was 'This is too complicated.' It felt like I smashed my head with a sack of tomatoes, standing in the middle of tomato juices without wiping it. Still? I spent four months to narrow my project down, but should it be considered as complicated?

Matt talked to me with patience, mentioning his previous project about locomotion. He also tried to create mind-bogglingly complicated interaction but ended up with vibration motors that participants could wear. It was so simple. Much simpler than the original plan, however, its interaction was filled with satisfaction to deliver the purpose of the art installation well. I was fascinated by his project, but in my mind, I was stubborn to change my plan. I still thought the ukulele is the best choice because I know it well compared to other musical instruments, and state vectors can be mapped onto four different ukulele string. I thought there's nothing more suitable than the ukulele.

So, on Wednesday, I did soldering for mini solenoids, listened to the advice from Matt and Louis (he did such a complicated robot hand piano project for his PhD), bought the ukulele from Flying Tigers and went back to work. And there were two sessions afterwards, about the graduation show and the dissertation.
