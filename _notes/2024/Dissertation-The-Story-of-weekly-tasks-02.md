As I've mentioned before, now's the time to implement the precious `Micromoth for Arduino` library to the Physical computing part. Before that, I needed to confirm the detailed visualisation sketch and the technical sketch. I was able to do this with the eureka moment, but lot of struggle happened in the background.

The problem was, I still couldn't visualise the exact art installation in my head. The ideal image is from the animated computer music series, [Animusic](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11rcBnKdlyPd--MRTJOMn__12IZ7S2So&si=d4g4a3h25SV3akei), which I first watched 13 years ago (2009!), and which has been the huge inspiration since then. In 'Resonant Chamber', it introduces plucking movements of robot fingers alongside the perfectly synchronised string music.

This served as the building block of my belief when I was 11 years old, the belief which computers can be the composers and partners of musicians. I think that's why I first imagined this similar image in my head and tried to buy the ukulele/guitar for the MSc project. Also, the electric guitar is my main musical instrument. Next, it both sounds and looks awesome in the art exhibition, with its iconic visuals with such a powerful amp⋯⋯.
