[[Dissertation-The-Story-of-weekly-tasks-02]]

This week was full of important company events, also the most precious day in mankind-my birthday! ðŸŽ‚ So, this week's log is more a diary of Thursday, 14th November.
I didn't want to spend my birthday with nervous feelings and that's why I didn't go to work and stayed at CCI from 9 to 5. As I've mentioned in the previous week's log, this week is fully dedicated on digital fabrication. Also, such a good timing, that the acrylic sheets, wind chimes and fishing lines have just arrived. So, I went to CCI, and focused on reminding my memories of 3D printers and laser cutters.

First, I needed to design an acrylic disk for hanging wind chimes, an Arduino and servos. Because it needs to be printed on a laser cutter, I used Adobe Illustrator. The biggest acrylic sheet that I could get was 600mm x 450mm so the maximum diameter of the disk will be 450mm. Originally, I wanted to make it bigger. However, after the session of PG Graduation Show, this size is more plausible.
I added the tiny holes (5mm of diameter) for fishing lines, some decorations which look exactly like Google Quantum AI's quantum computer. The disk is amber, and it leaded to the beautiful result.

Before that, I put Wie's chicken legs into the 3D printer. It was trickier than I thought because my USB was in exFAT format, not FAT32 format that the printer wants. I needed to erase it once more and feed the sliced 3D model into the machine. Thankfully, it worked smoothly. I still remember the nightmare about spaghetti-styled threads that ruined the print last yearâ‹¯â‹¯.
