# In the beginning...
What is the main goal of creative coding projects? What's the limitation of them? Why am I learning this? Which element should I focus and improve if I want to be a true artist/developer? In this term, I want to answer to these questions while developing each week's assignments. For all of the outcomes, I selected three artworks that can answer my questions best. The first project is a narrative scene, the second is the collection of narrative scenes which becomes an interactive animation, and the last one is deconstructing typography. Each subheading contains a brief introduction, a short demo video, and a link to a `p5.js` editor. (I prefer this for weekly assignments because it's more convenient when you need to manage lots of internal files.)

## Weekly project 01: "It's Cold Outside"

With the wonderful song 'Time in a Bottle' by Jim Croce, I created calm, Adobe Illustrator style snowy scene. I kept experimenting recreating vector style image only on computer code, rather than complicated Graphic User Interface(GUI). The extension of 'A Cloud full of Cheese and Other Short Stories' project, I tried to implement a short story inside of a `p5.js` sketch. Whenever I see the computational art, I couldn't stop thinking but there are less sensation, relaxed, and thoughtful touches than fine art projects. I brought strict OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) style for particle systems, their lifecycles, and every elements inside of the sketch. Added user interactions with mouse click (a candle) and a slider (the wind which affects snow particles) this virtual window delivers a deep thought to the user who wants to relax, to focus, or to take a look at the computer and find any meanings from the relationship between the user and the computer.

## Weekly project 02: "ignition"

From week four, I was ordered to act like a senior developer and make an interactive animation until week six. This is the outcome of the group project. (Members: me(Astryd Park), Mishma Toppo, Shuqi(Liz) Qiu, Xinyue Chen, Yawen Lyu, Yi Xu, Yiwen Dai, Yucheng Wang)
